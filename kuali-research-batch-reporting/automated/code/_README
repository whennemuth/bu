Notes
-----
 
* The 'code' folder stores all code needed to run the various scheduled batch reports. 

* It's used as a sort of code "storage" area. The "_loader.sh" script selects code to
  run based on a supplied parm and loads that code into the parent "automated" folder in the
  docker container. 
  
* Each SQL script run *must* include an EXIT statement to tell the SQLcl subprocess launched 
  by Python that its job is done. If missing, SQLcl subprocess will sit and wait for the 
  next instruction, which never comes.

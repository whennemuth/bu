DO NOT REMOVE THIS FILE FROM THE BUILD CONTEXT.
This file will keep the COPY instruction in the Dockerfile from failing and stopping the build if no tomcat gz file is present.
In that case, this dummy file is copied into the image.
The next step is to identify if any .gz file is present in the image that does not have the term "dummmy" in it.
The first such file found will be the tomcat tar file to use, otherwise an attempt to download it from the standard apache website location will occur.

|                      |                    Dev-ops Show and Tell                     |
| -------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------: |
| ![](showandtell.png) | **BASIC IDEA:**<br />Dev-ops training was informative but does not instantly produce a working skillset.<br/>A skillset is developed by cracking the books and PLENTY of practical use.<br />This is for those of us who've had no exposure to any dev-ops/AWS and are on the ground floor.<br /><br />**PROPOSAL:** <br />A routine meetup in a show-and-tell format where we go over what we have done from the latest in a program of bite size steps designed to slowly beef up on AWS and dev-ops. |

**Example***:*  Use cloud-formation to construct an ec2-instance that runs a simple hello-world website  (in language of choice).

-  No cutting and pasting.
- Consult among yourselves between show and tells?
- I supply links and documentation recommendations?
- The meetings would not be training.
- Members train themselves between meetings.
- The meetings would be motivational, by providing a social event and way of sharing/relating efforts with others.
- I can provide a logical sequence of target subjects to play with.



**LONG TERM TARGET?**: 
Hands-on ability and practical readiness for common cloud-related functions on AWS and linux environments. A potential exercise to demonstrate this kind of readiness could be to put a sandbox version of an app currently supported by a member up on the cloud.

 

**LOGISTICS/CONSIDERATIONS:**

-  Meeting and exercises would always take a back seat to the job.
- It would be optimum to all meet up in person. How to manage this?
- How often to meet? Weekly? Every two weeks?
-  What if someone has to skip a meeting or two?
